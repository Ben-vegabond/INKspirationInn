Welcome!
As a new developer I am trying out different techniques with projects.
Here I developed an Express JS Note Taker, it is a simple. lightweight, and fast web application that allows the user to write and save, and delete notes at their leasure.

## 🪄 User Story
```
**GIVEN** a note-taking application

**WHEN** I open the Note Taker

**THEN** I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

**WHEN** I click on the link to the notes page

**THEN** I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

**WHEN** I enter a new note title and the note’s text

**THEN** a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

**WHEN** I click on the Save icon

**THEN** the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

**WHEN** I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

**THEN** that note appears in the right-hand column

**WHEN** I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

**THEN** I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
